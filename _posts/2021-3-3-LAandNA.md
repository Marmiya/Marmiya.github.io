# Linear Algebra

##  1.Homogeneous linear equations

If the number of unknown number is larger than equations, the equations has non-zero solution.  

Otherwise, the equations only has zero solution.

## 2.Weierstrass approximation theorem

Every continous function defined on a closed interval [a,b] can be uniformly approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial function. 

If the function's cycle equal to 2Î , trigonometric function series can be used to approximate.

## 3.Vendarmonde matrix
