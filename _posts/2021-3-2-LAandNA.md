At begin:

Computer Graphic is a subject witch needs both of math and program.

Unfortunately, CS student may be a master of programming, but not good at math like Algebra,

Vice versa.

I am the former, so I want to make a list to help someone like me.

Because I am a freshman likewise, it's orderless and incomplete.

Maybe one day, I will reorganize this blog.

# Linear Algebra

##  1.Homogeneous linear equations

If the number of unknown number is larger than equations, the equations has non-zero solution.  

Otherwise, the equations only has zero solution.

## 2.Weierstrass approximation theorem

Every continuous function defined on a closed interval [a,b] can be uniformly approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial function. 

If the function's cycle equal to 2Î , trigonometric function series can be used to approximate.

## 3.Vendarmonde matrix

## 4. Homogeneous Coordinates
